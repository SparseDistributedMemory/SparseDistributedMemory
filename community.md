This is a framework which can be adapted to any usage of a Sparse Distributed Memory (Kanerva, 1988):  new theoretical results, new applications, new machine learning models, etc.  

 We have been working on Pentii Kanerva's Sparse Distributed Memory:
   - The first [paper considered the range of dimensions that an SDM should have were it to respect i) chunking-by-averaging, and ii) the "magic number 7"](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0015592);
   - a second [paper studied the critical distance as the memory becomes saturated](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00222/full);
   - a third paper (underway) studies interaction effects between different attractors, and
   - a fourth paper will document this [highly-palallel SDM framework](https://github.com/msbrogli/sdm-framework) developed by [Dr. Marcelo Brogliato](https://github.com/msbrogli).  

We would really like to ask you for feedback, and, should you find it useful, please consider a link or citation:
