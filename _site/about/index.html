<blockquote>
  <p>How is memory gradually built up during one’s conscious, or even unconscious,
life and thought? My guess is that everything we experience is classified and
registered on very many parallel channels in different locations.<br />
<strong>Stanislaw Ulam</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pentti Kanerva’s memory model was a revelation for me: it was
the very first piece of research I had ever come across that made
me feel I could glimpse the distant goal of understanding how the
brain works as a whole. It gave me a concrete sense for how
familiar mental phenomena could be thought of as distributed
patterns of micro-events, thanks to beautiful mathematics. <br />
<strong>Douglas Hofstadter</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The emphasis might have been on the breadth of topics, in
detriment of depth here or there. The work on, say, reinforcement
learning, is most definitely not the last word we will see on the
subject, but a challenge left for readers to contemplate. But
this is due to our research group’s enthusiasm for the topic; we
do indeed believe that SDM is — if not correct — extremely close
to a full scientific understanding of human long-term memory. If
so, it is such a monumental achievement that we want readers to
be able to see all of what we see and imagine the vastness of
possibilities.</p>

  <p>Ralph Waldo Emerson once said: <em>do not go where the path may
lead. Go, instead, where there is no path, and leave a trail</em>.
Professor Pentti Kanerva has left the trail. It is my job to
illuminate it and to pave it and to clear it; to try to deliver
an easier pathway for the next generation. Some essays
completely shut the door close at the end; this one intends to
leave it wide open. As the reader might have noticed, this final
section does not read as an analysis of the work done; it reads,
instead, as a desideratum, a prologue, a yearning for others to
join me in imagining the shape of things to come.<br />

<p>Exploring the AI potential of <em>Sparse Distributed Memory</em>.</p>

<p>Here you will find all sorts of resources to start (or enhance) your research (or industrial) work on models related to Pentti Kanerva’s Sparse Distributed Memory.</p>

<p>Some things are as silly as a small jupyter notebook, toying around with some experiment, or with the mathematics of SDM. Others include a full-blown massively parallel GPGU Cross-platform open-source buzzword-complete framework.</p>

<h3 id="heres-our-desiderata">here’s our desiderata:</h3>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> * A massively parallel framework in which users can test cognitive neuroscience theories;
 * a full documentation of the framework;
 * An open-source book, with a visual tutorial of the system, its relation to neuroscience and psychology, and numerous new scientific results;
 * A collection of SDM resources, links, chronology of papers, etc;
 * Slides following the Jupyter notebooks used;
 * A video-based mini-course on SDM.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="sparse-distributed-memory-framework">Sparse Distributed Memory Framework</h3>
<p>This is a framework which can be adapted to any usage of a Sparse Distributed Memory (Kanerva, 1988):  new theoretical results, new applications, new machine learning models, etc.</p>

<p>We have been working on Pentii Kanerva’s Sparse Distributed Memory:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0015592">paper considered the range of dimensions that an SDM should have were it to respect i) chunking-by-averaging, and ii) the “magic number 7”</a>;</li>
  <li>a second <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00222/full">paper studied the critical distance as the memory becomes saturated</a>;</li>
  <li>a third paper (underway) studies interaction effects between different attractors, and</li>
  <li>a fourth paper will document this <a href="https://github.com/msbrogli/sdm-framework">highly-palallel SDM framework</a> developed by <a href="https://github.com/msbrogli">Dr. Marcelo Brogliato</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-to-build--test">How to build &amp; test</h4>
<p>To generate the library and run some tests:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd src/
make
make tests
./test1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To run Python tests:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python tests.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In dev mode, there should be a symbolic link from <code class="highlighter-rouge">src/libsdm.so</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">sdm/_libsdm.so</code>. If it does not exist, create one running:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd sdm/
ln -s ../src/libsdm.so _libsdm.so
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="how-to-install">How to install</h4>
<p>This framework has the following dependencies: <code class="highlighter-rouge">libbsd</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">libOpenCL</code>.</p>
